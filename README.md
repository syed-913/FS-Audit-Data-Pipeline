# üêß Remote Linux FS Audit & Data Pipeline

### üîß Description
This project automates the process of gathering filesystem (FS) usage data from remote Linux machines, formats the data into a structured CSV report, and stores it securely in a remote MySQL database. The tool uses modular scripting with Bash and Python, applies secure credential handling via encryption, and includes OS detection logic to ensure command compatibility.

### üß∞ Features

- üîç Remote OS detection before execution
- üìÅ Collect filesystem usage data (excluding temp mounts)
- üìÑ Save report as CSV with additional fields (IP, hostname, date)
- üîí Encrypt credentials securely using Fernet
- üì° Insert CSV data into remote MySQL DB
- üß† Modular JSON-based command structure
- üë®‚Äçüíª Optional view of DB entries through command-line prompt

### üìÅ File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `my_commands.json` | Stores Linux shell commands to execute remotely |
| `script_for_csv.py` | Executes remote commands, generates CSV report |
| `the_great_python_project.py` | Inserts CSV data into remote DB, decrypts credentials |
| `credentials.enc` | Encrypted file containing database login credentials |

---

### üîí Security Practices

- Credentials are **not hardcoded** ‚Äî stored in a separate, encrypted file.
- Only **non-temporary mount points** are included in FS report.
- Modularized and **reusable scripts** for real-world environments.

---

### üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- MySQL Connector: `pip install mysql-connector-python`  
- Paramiko: `pip install paramiko`  
- Cryptography: `pip install cryptography`

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syed-913/linux-automation-scripts.git
   ```
2. Place your encrypted credentials file as credentials.enc
3. Run the CSV generator:
   ```bash
   python3 script_for_csv.py
   ```
4. Push data to DB:
   ```bash
   python3 the_great_python_project.py
   ```

üìå Future Enhancements

- Add email alerting for disk usage thresholds
- Expand to support Windows servers (PowerShell-based)
- Use SQLite as local fallback if DB connection fails
- Dockerize the setup
